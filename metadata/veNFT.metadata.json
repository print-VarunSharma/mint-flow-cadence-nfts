  "description": "Story: The times I truly feel free and in paradise are at festivals with my favourite humans :). Listening to electronic music, overlooking the Gorge Canyon at the Gorge Amphitheatre, with the sunset going down behind the main stage and a view that looks like it's right out of painting - there's just nothing like it. It's Digital Paradise! This picture was taken at a special festival for me, Paradiso 2017. It's at the Gorge Amphitheatre, in Washington state.",
